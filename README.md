## Photo Gallery Imagebox

## By: Poli Gonzalez

## Introduction

Over the course of 2-weeks, our team of 7 developers worked to make a mock Amazon item detail page for a Front-End capstone project. 

## What does the app do? 

    * Enhances the User experience for viewing the item the user might be interested in purchasing by providing pictures.
    * Ensures Users are knowing what type of product they will recieve with detailed images on the product.

## Tech stack ( you can include logos)

## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated

    * Where will I store all images used for the correlating items and how will I access them.
    * How will i make the first render of images appear and every item search after.
    * I learned of a few different ways to store images into a database or an S3 bucket to make it assessable to the team.
  
## Challenges that were unexpected
    
    * Sectioning off designated areas for images to render inside
     - Wasnt thinking of a placeholder for any image to render in.
      - Learned how to use Grid to allocate space for these 'blocks' for images to appear inside of.

    * When am image is clicked on, render of how the view will change to view image over the item detail page.
    </p>
  
## How does the app work?

    * What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
    * OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
    * Optionally include a diagram
    * How does the tech stack come together?

## What research was required?

## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.

    * Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
    * What did you learn from the process
    * What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
    * Writing tests
    * Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Any non-MVP tickets (optional)

 - Code refactorings
 - Performance Optimizations
 - Additional features
 - etc

## Notes from your Sprint Retro



## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?

    * Dynamic image rendering specific to item ID.
    * Image carousel rendered when images clicked on to view over the overall page.
    * Image Zoom functionality.
